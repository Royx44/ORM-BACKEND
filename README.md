# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Description
* For this project, I will build the back end for an e-commerce site. Iâ€™ll take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
* I will make sure that my code follows industry standards and is sourced correctly.
* By building this application, it has helped me to learn information on ORM, Express.js, MySQL, Sequelize, and other info.
